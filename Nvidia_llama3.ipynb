I want it to be private, and I want it to be in a place where I can be sure he'll show up alone. And I want it to happen at night, under the cover of darkness. That's when I'll be at my most... persuasive. (Mood: 0)\n",

Yeah, that's the one. I'll be there, and I'll be alone. But don't think for a second that I'm going to come quietly. I've got a few tricks up my sleeve, and I'm not going down without a fight.

It's been a long time coming, but it's finally over. (Mood: 25) Ah, I think it's time for me to release the girl. *releases the girl* There you go, officer. The girl is safe. And I'm... (sighs) ...done.\n",
